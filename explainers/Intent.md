# Intent

An intent is a textual explanation of what the creator intended to do. It should explain overall what the goal is of what was created and also describe any relevant edge cases that were explicitly handled. 

If new edge cases pop up that do not act according to the intent, the creator can update the implementation to more closely match the original intent.

If the intent contradicts the behavior, this should be considered a bug and you should be careful to base your logic around that as it might be fixed in a later release.

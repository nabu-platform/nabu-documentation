# Backend vs Frontend

While the definition might change slightly depending on the context, in general a backend and frontend refer to the different parts in a typical web application.

The **frontend** is the browser running on the computer of the user, it deals with visualizing the application and allowing the user to interact with it.

The **backend** of a web application is the part of the software running on the server. It usually performs all the data operations, validates security, integrates with other systems that might exist... For all intents and purposes this part of the application has no real GUI.

There are many types of applications that only have a backend, for example integration solutions, batch calculations, business processes...

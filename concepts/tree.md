# Knowledge tree

The knowledge tree represents the separate layers (in increasing complexity) that you need to understand to create truly complex applications.

Within each layer, there are multiple concepts that you need to understand. Some concepts lean heavily on other concepts and should be read in order, some are just random addendums that might be interesting for specific usecases or skipped without impacting your overall understanding.

The non-core articles are not required to be read to "complete" the layer, they can be fun additions or handy for specific usecases but not necessary reading material.

## Annotations

The annotations we use are:

@layer the layer this belongs to
@title the title of this page
@dependencies you can reference other articles that should be read before this one (syntax path1, path2,...)
@core true/false

## Excercises

The idea is to couple exercises to particular articles. Once you have finished the exercises you "unlock" the dependent articles, allowing you to unlock the layer in full.
So read the article at your own leasure, then complete an exercise to "finish" the article.

Once done, new articles (or layers!) unlock.

The documentation is of course also available without this forced progression.

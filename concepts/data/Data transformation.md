## Transformation

In the above example, if you still really need to support a dutch version of the format because a third party insists on it, you can agree with that third party on a different model and +transform+ the data before you send it to your business logic. But in such a scenario, the business logic remains unchanged and rock solid while you simply have a second, predefined, validatable model agreement with another party.

Data transformation can be a straight mapping where the same fields are present but simply with another name or a different, convertible value or can become more complex by enriching, filtering,... the data.
